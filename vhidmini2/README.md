# HID Minidriver Sample (UMDF version 2)

The *HID minidriver* sample demonstrates how to write a HID minidriver using User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF).

The sample demonstrates how to communicate with an HID minidriver from an HID client using a custom-feature item in order to control certain features of the HID minidriver. This is needed since other conventional modes for communicating with a driver, like custom IOCTL or WMI, do not work with the HID minidriver. The sample also is useful in testing the correctness of a HID report descriptor without using a physical device.
